# Fractal-based-image-processing
This project contains matlab-based implementations of fractal-based image processing methods. 
Currently, two methods are provided, including:

_FractalSREN: Image super-resolution and enhancement based on local fractal analysis of gradient_:
* Xu, Hongteng, Guangtao Zhai, and Xiaokang Yang. "[Single image super-resolution with detail enhancement based on local fractal analysis of gradient.](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6520871/)" IEEE Transactions on circuits and systems for video technology 23.10 (2013): 1740-1754.

_FDIF: fractal dimension invariant filter for curve detection and image-style transfer_:
* Xu, Hongteng, et al. "[Fractal Dimension Invariant Filtering and Its CNN-based Implementation.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06036)" arXiv preprint arXiv:1603.06036 (2016).

More methods and applications will come soon!
